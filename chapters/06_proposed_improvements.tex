\chapter{Proposed Improvements}\label{chapter:propImprovements}

\section{M2M}
"Upgrade" to full PKI instead of symmetric keys. Symmetric keys have more management overhead (switching of SM-SR is an almost impossible task). The "computational overhead" advantage of symmetric keys is weak, since asymmetric cryptography and key agreement is already implemented (SM-DP/ISD-P).

Implement allowance checks. 

Ownership Transfer Protocol (SM-SR Change) complicated - also often unwanted by SM-SR owners!

\section{Consumer}
Activation Code: Sign the code string!
The AC can be up to 255 Bytes in length for "User Experience" and the ability, to input the AC by hand. This argument fails a bit, since user will either scan the appropriate QR Code, or Copy-Paste the AC-string if the device does not have a camera. Therefore, the length is probably neglegible.
Signing the code string allows the LPA to directly verify, if the AC has been altered without sending any requests to SM-DP+. A ECDSA signature of an 256-Bit ECC key is 64 bytes long. 
How to solve the problem of verifying the signature? Who needs to sign it? Usually MNO generates AC. How to get certificate of MNO?

Enforce signature of LPA to be able to manage eUICCs

\section{Both}
"Bootstrapping" mechanisms. Currently every eSIM relies on a pre-provisioned fallback profile.

eUICC OS updates over provisioning system?
